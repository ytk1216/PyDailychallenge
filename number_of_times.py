# Create a function that calculates how many times an integer can be 
# divided by another given integer. If the answer of resulting 
# divisions does not result in an integer, that division is not counted 
# towards the number of times. As an example: 
# If n is 10 and divisor is 3, since in the first division 10/3 doesn't 
# return an integer, this division doesn't count towards the number 
# of times and therefore its number of times should be 0.
# def divisions(n, divisor):
#     return number_of_times
def divisions(n, divisor):
    number_of_times = 0
    while n%divisor == 0:
        n = int(n/divisor)
        number_of_times += 1
    return number_of_times

print(divisions(24,2))
